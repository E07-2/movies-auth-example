# Boilerplate Client / Server

## Getting Started

1. run `npm run setup`
2. run `npm run build`

> Make some tea, this may take a while
> You only need to run these commands once

## Usage

1. run `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js` (if you do not have nodemon installed)

##### Changing the frontend

If you want to change the client, you must rebuild the static client files

1. run `npm run build`

## Problems?

- My frontend is not showing!
  1. Check your URL
  2. Build your frontend folder with `npm run setup`
  3. Make sure your frontend / backend routes do not collide
